# Hospital Patient Management System
You are required to develop a C program that manages patient records in a hospital. Each patient
has specific details, including their name, age, gender, ID, and a condition description. The
program should allow users to perform the following operations using a menu-driven approach:
● Add a New Patient: This allows the user to enter the details of a new patient and store
them in the hospital records.
● Search for Patients by ID: This allows the user to search for a patient by their ID and
display their details.
● Update Patient Condition by ID: This allows the user to update a patient’s condition
by providing their ID.
● Display the List of All Patients: This displays the details of all patients currently
registered, with recovered patients listed first.
● Exit the Program: This terminates the program.
You must first create a structure named Patient to store the following details:
● Name (String)
● Age (Integer)
● Gender (Character: 'M' for male, 'F' for female)
● ID (Integer)
● Condition (String)
The program should use an array of Patient to store up to 100 patients.
Instructions:
● Implement the menu using conditional statements (if-else or switch-case).
● Ensure that the maximum number of patients that can be recorded is 100.
